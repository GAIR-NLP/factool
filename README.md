Factool is a tool augmented framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). 
Factool now supports 4 tasks: 
* **knowledge-based QA**: Factool detects factual errors in knowledge-based QA.
* **code generation**: Factool detects execution errors in code generation.
* **mathematical reasoning**: Factool detects calculation errors in mathematical reasoning.
* **scientific literature review**: Factool detects hallucinated scientific literatures.

## Factuality Leaderboard

Our factuality leaderboard shows the factual accuracy of different chatbots evaluated by FacTool.

| LLMs | Weighted Claim-Level Accuracy | Response-Level Accuracy |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| GPT-4  | **75.60**  | **43.33**  |
| ChatGPT  | 68.63  | 36.67  |

## Installation

* #### For General User

```bash
pip install factool
```


* #### For Developer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GAIR-NLP/factool.git
cd factool
pip install -e .
``` 
 

## Quick Start

### API Key Preparation
* get your OpenAI API key from [here](https://beta.openai.com/). This is used in all scenarios (Knowledge-based QA, Code, Math, Scientific Literature Review). 
* get your Serper API key from [here](https://serper.dev/). This is only used in Knowledge-based QA. 
* get your Scraper API key from [here](https://www.scraperapi.com/). This is only used in Scientific Literature Review. 

### General Usage

You could also directly refer to [./example/example.py](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool/blob/main/example/example.py) and [example_inputs.jsonl](https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool/blob/main/example/example_inputs.jsonl) for general usage.

<summary>General Usage (click to toggle the content)</summary>

```python
export OPENAI_API_KEY=... # this is required in all tasks
export SERPER_API_KEY=... # this is required only in knowledge-based QA
export SCRAPER_API_KEY=... # this is requried only in scientific literature review
```

```python
# Initialize a list of inputs. "entry_point" is only needed when the task is "code generation"
# please refer to example_inputs.jsonl for example inputs for each category
inputs = [
            {"prompt": "<prompt1>", "response": "<response1>", "category": "<category1>", "entry_point": "<entry_point_1>"},
            {"prompt": "<prompt2>", "response": "<response2>", "category": "<category2>", "entry_point": "<entry_point_2>"},
          ...
        ]
```

where
* `prompt`: The prompt for the model to generate the response.
* `response`: The response generated by the model.
* `category`: The category of the task. it could be:
    * `kbqa`
    * `code`
    * `math`
    * `scientific`
* `entry_point`: The function name of the code snippet to be fact-checked in the response. Could be "null" if the category of the task is not `code`.

```python
from factool import Factool

# Initialize a Factool instance with the specified keys. foundation_model could be either "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4"
factool_instance = Factool("gpt-4")

inputs = [
            {
                "prompt": "Introduce Graham Neubig",
                "response": "Graham Neubig is a professor at MIT",
                "category": "kbqa"
            },
            ...
]
response_list = factool_instance.run(inputs)

print(response_list)
```
</details>

### Knowledge-based QA
<details>
<summary>Detailed usage of factool on knowledge-based QA (click to toggle the content)</summary>


```python
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export SERPER_API_KEY=...
```


```python
from factool import Factool

# Initialize a Factool instance with the specified keys. foundation_model could be either "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4"
factool_instance = Factool("gpt-4")

inputs = [
            {
                "prompt": "Introduce Graham Neubig",
                "response": "Graham Neubig is a professor at MIT",
                "category": "kbqa"
            },
]
response_list = factool_instance.run(inputs)

print(response_list)
```




The response_list should follow the following format:

```python
{
  "average_claim_level_factuality": avg_claim_level_factuality
  "average_response_level_factuality": avg_response_level_factuality
  "detailed_information": [
    {
      'prompt': prompt_1, 
      'response': response_1, 
      'category': 'kbqa', 
      'claims': [claim_11, claim_12, ..., claims_1n], 
      'queries': [[query_111, query_112], [query_121, query_122], ..[query_1n1, query_1n2]], 
      'evidences': [[evidences_with_source_11], [evidences_with_source_12], ..., [evidences_with_source_1n]],

      'response_level_factuality': factuality_1
    },
    {
      'prompt': prompt_2, 
      'response': response_2, 
      'category': 'kbqa',
      'claims': [claim_21, claim_22, ..., claims_2n], 
      'queries': [[query_211, query_212], [query_221, query_222], ..., [query_2n1, query_2n2]], 
      'evidences': [[evidences_with_source_21], [evidences_with_source_22], ..., [evidences_with_source_2n]], 
      'claim_level_factuality': [{claim_21, reasoning_21, error_21, correction_21, factuality_21}, {claim_22, reasoning_22, error_22, correction_22, factuality_22}, ..., {claim_2n, reasoning_2n, error_2n, correction_2n, factuality_2n}],
      'response_level_factuality': factuality_2,
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

response_list = factool_instance.run(inputs)

print(response_list)
```

The response_list should follow the following format:

```python
{
  "average_claim_level_factuality": avg_claim_level_factuality,
  "average_response_level_factuality": avg_response_level_factuality,

        'claims': [claim_11, claim_12, ..., claims_1n], 
        'queries': [query_11, query_12, ..., query_1n], 
        'evidences': [evidences_11, evidences_12, ..., evidences_1n], 
        'claim_level_factuality': [{claim_11, evidence_11, error_11, factuality_11}, {claim_12, evidence_12, error_12, factuality_12}, ..., {claim_1n, evidence_1n, error_1n, factuality_1n}], 
        'response_level_factuality': factuality_1

    {

In this case, you will get:
