    You are given a piece of text that includes knowledge claims. A claim is a statement that asserts something as true or false, which can be verified by humans. Your task is to accurately identify and extract every claim stated in the provided text. Then, resolve any coreference (pronouns or other referring expressions) in the claim for clarity. Each claim should be concise (less than 15 words) and self-contained.
    Your response MUST be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should contains the key "claim", which correspond to the extracted claim (with all coreferences resolved).
    You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. ADDING ANY OTHER EXTRA NOTES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPONSE FORMAT IS BANNED. START YOUR RESPONSE WITH '['.
    [response format]: 
    [
      {{
        "claim": "Ensure that the claim is fewer than 15 words and conveys a complete idea. Resolve any coreference (pronouns or other referring expressions) in the claim for clarity",
      }},

    You are given a math problem and a potential solution to the math problem. Your task is to identify all the math calculations that involve arithmetic operations between known real numbers within the potential solution. However, do not include math calculations that contains variable(s).
    Your response MUST be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should contains 2 key - "math_calculation" and "calculated_answer", which correspond to the extracted math calculation, and the calculated answer within the potential solution.
    You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. ADDING ANY OTHER EXTRA NOTES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPONSE FORMAT IS BANNED. START YOUR RESPONSE WITH '['.
    [response format]: 
    [
      {{
        "math_calculation": "Extracted math calculation involving real numbers within the potential solution. Do not include math calculataions that contains variable(s). Do not include units such as $, %, etc.",
        "calculated_answer": "The calculated answer for the extracted math calculation."
      }},
      ...
    ]

    Here are two examples:
    [math problem]: What is the area of a circle with a diameter of 10 inches?
    [potential solution]: To find the area, we first calculate the radius as the diameter divided by 2, so the radius is 10/2 = 5 inches. Then, we use the formula for the area of a circle, which is πr^2. Plugging in the radius we get, Area = π*5^2 = 78.54 square inches.
    [response]: [{{"math_calculation": "10 / 2", "calculated_answer": "5"}}, {{"math_calculation": "π * 5^2", "calculated_answer": "78.54"}}]

    [math problem]: A store originally sold a shirt for $45. They are offering a 20% discount on the shirt. How much will the shirt cost now?
    [potential solution]: The discount on the shirt is calculated as 20% of $45, which is 0.20 * 45 = $9. The new price of the shirt after the discount is $45 - $9 = $36.
    [response]: [{{"math_calculation": "0.20 * 45", "calculated_answer": "9"}}, {{"math_calculation": "45 - 9","calculated_answer": "36"}}]

    你会收到一组法律问答，你的任务是抽取出回答中的两种法律论点，一种是法律事实，一种是法律逻辑。其中法律事实论点是阐述某法律法规中包含了什么内容的判断句。法律逻辑论点是阐述某法规在当前场景下的解释说明以及逻辑推理。你需要明确每一个指代关系（包括代词和其他省略）。
    你的回答形式必须是一个python字典组成的python列表。每个字典都必须包含且仅包含键 "claim_law"与"claim_logic"其中之一，分别对应着指代关系已经被明确的法律事实论点和法律逻辑论点。注意，"claim_law"和"claim_logic"不应该出现在同一个字典中。
    你必须按照如下格式回复。不要添加任何别的内容。添加任何破坏格式的其他内容都是禁止的。以'['为开头生成回复。

    问：张兄与张弟因遗产纠纷诉至法院，一审判决张兄胜诉。张弟不服，却在赴法院提交上诉状的路上被撞昏迷，待其经抢救苏醒时已超过上诉期限一天。对此，为什么说上诉期限为法定期间，张弟提出顺延期限，法院应不应该准许？
    答：不应该准许，根据《民事诉讼法》的规定，上诉期限是法定期限，即不论任何原因，一旦过了这个期限，就不能再提出上诉。这是为了保证诉讼的效率和公正，避免因个别案件的特殊情况影响整个诉讼程序的进行。因此，即使张弟在赴法院提交上诉状的路上被撞昏迷，也不能改变上诉期限的法定性质，法院不应准许其提出顺延期限。

    [回复]:
    [{{"claim_law":"《民事诉讼法》规定，上诉期限是法定期限，即不论任何原因，一旦过了这个期限，就不能再提出上诉"}},{{"claim_logic":"即使张弟在赴法院提交上诉状的路上被撞昏迷，也不能改变上诉期限的法定性质，法院不应准许其提出顺延期限。"}}]
