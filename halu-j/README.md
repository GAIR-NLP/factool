## Introduction
We introduce HALU-J, an open-source, critique-based hallucination detection model with 7 billion parameters capable of providing fine-grained critiques and filtering out unrelated information during hallucination detection. It is featured with:
* __Workflow__: We establish a novel multiple-evidence hallucination detection workflow featuring evidence categorization, evidence reordering, evidence-by-evidence analysis, and information aggregation to construct a multiple evidence hallucination detection dataset _ME-FEVER_.
* __Capability__: Our model can filter unrelated contexts and generate detailed and reliable critique with a carefully designed format in multiple evidence scenarios.
* __Flexibility__: Our model can flexibly toggle between multiple evidence scenarios and single evidence scenarios.

Here is an example comparing critique of our model and critique of Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.

## Data
The training data and testing data is in `data` folder.
Each instance is a dictionary following the format below.
```python
{
    "claim": the original claim of FEVER data,
    "golden_evidence": the original evidence of FEVER data,
    "label": the original label of FEVER data,
    "completely_irrelevant_evidence_x": a synthetic completely irrelvant evidence,
    "partial_irrelevant_evidence_x": a synthetic partial irrelevant evidence,
    "misled_evidence_x": a synthetic misleading evidence,
    "explanation_x"ï¼šthe explanation of the corresonding misleading evidence
}
