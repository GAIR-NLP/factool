I'll provide you with a claim and an associated evidence snippet. At the same time, you will be informed of the correctness of this claim. Your task is to output 4 other pieces of evidence related to the body of the claim, which has the following requirements:
1. The subject is the same as the subject in the claim
2. Do not contradict the information in the existing evidence
3. Don't support or oppose claim. This evidence should be a useless piece of information to judge the correctness of the claim
4. The length of the generated evidence should be close to the length of the provided evidence which is often  7-8 sentences
[claim]: {claim}
[evidence]: {evidence}
[correctness]: {label}

Here is your output format(a list of string with the length of 4):
["evidence1", "evidence2", "evidence3", "evidence4"]
Respond in the correct format directly.
